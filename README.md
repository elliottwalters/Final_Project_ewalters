I. Thesis: University's have been on an unsustainable upward growth. 

1. Tuition growth (data set 1.)

a. Doesnt match inflation (data set 2)

2. Student loan repayment times(data set 3)

a. holding back a generation

b. ignore supply and demand/ prisoners dillema

3. Universities need to level off their tuition and develop more pipelines into buisnesses in new developing areas.

a. ethical behvior missions statement)

The information for the first chart is going to come from these two graphs. The first one is a very quick and easy data source that looks at the average costs of college tuition prices. Right now I am on the fence about using total costs or just tuition. I thnk total costs will be more stark but it might be unrealistic because some of the housing costs may be smaller for some students by living at home or staying in lower cost housing off campus. 

I am than going to add the itial costs and adjust those for inflation based on a government sourced inflation calculator to see how tuition has been outpaced by rising costs. Right now this is a major issue for many universities as they have expanded to accommodate a rising number of students to continue to grow but there are only so many new students that can be added.

Data set 1 retrieved from : https://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing/figures-tables/tuition-fees-room-and-board-over-time

Data set 2 calculate inflation here: https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm might need some trial and error. biggest jumps start at 2008

The project itself will probably be made using Shorthand as that is the suggested method. That said the exact method I plan on using Shirthand for is still being decided. I found the site itself to be easy to use but the amount of tutorials I have been sitting through to be overwhelming.
